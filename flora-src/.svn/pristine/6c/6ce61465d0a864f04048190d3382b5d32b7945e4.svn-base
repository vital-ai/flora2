    Emacs major mode for Flora and Ergo
    ===================================

Put flora.elc (ergo.elc, in case of Ergo) in a directory that is on the
load path of Emacs.
The easiest way is to have a separate directory for emacs libraries.
A directory can be added to emacs search path by putting the following in
the file ~/.emacs:

(setq load-path (cons "your-directory" load-path))

Next tell Emacs which files are Flora-2 or Ergo files, so it would
invoke the appropriate major mode automatically:

For Flora2:

   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.flr$" . flora-mode) auto-mode-alist))
   (autoload
       'flora-mode "flora" "Major mode for editing Flora-2 knowledge bases." t)


For Ergo:

   (setq auto-mode-alist
       (cons '("\\(\\.flr$\\|\\.ergo$\\|\\.ergotxt$\\)" . ergo-mode)
             auto-mode-alist))
   (autoload 'ergo-mode "ergo" "Major mode for editing Ergo knowledge bases." t)
